Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Game! This project is a simple, yet classic implementation of the timeless game that many of us have enjoyed playing over the years. The goal of this project was to create a user-friendly, interactive, and engaging version of Tic Tac Toe using Python, showcasing the fundamental principles of game development and programming logic.

Overview
This Tic Tac Toe game allows two players to compete against each other, taking turns to mark the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. This project was built with simplicity and functionality in mind, ensuring that both new and experienced players can enjoy the game.
